# DBTimeLine
An app for deploying database changes in correct order.

Interface pattern enables users to define their own database entities and use the engine from the core projects.
It's written partly in vb.net, partly in c# just and I apologize for this.

Solution is able to process plugins, customizations for specific users. This enables the same product to live in different databases with different requirements.
